TestShop
========
The program is a substitute for an online store with books and CDs. 

It was created to strength my knowledge of the basics of Java programming. 

In this program I use techniques such as abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, JavaBeans, generics, 
enum types, collections, polymorphism, overriding, overloading and others. 

The program has been written in accordance with the principles of object programming. 

It is ready to build with Maven.

This project will be further developed and improved by me.
